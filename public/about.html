<h1>About Me</h1>
<P>I started off in manufacturing working with CNC lathes and Mills now working with CNC Lasers. From learning to read Micromedors, calibers, height gages, scales, and other imperial measurements.
From understanding of customer satisfaction, on time delivery, and working with management to completing our goals. Some of the product I have worked with ranges from automotive, tool and die, and to the bicycle industry.
Every step was a joy and to the people I have learned from.
</P>
<p>Now jumping into the world of coding. My only goal is to help people be able to reach out to others that help contnet them to the world.
  As a web developer I'm looking to step up to the challenges of each project and looking to learn and grow while bringing people together.
